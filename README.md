# pyweb_io
PyWebIO provides a series of imperative functions to obtain user input and output on the browser, turning the browser into a “rich text terminal”, and can be used to build simple web applications or browser-based GUI applications. Using PyWebIO, developers can write applications just like writing terminal scripts (interaction based on input and print), without the need to have knowledge of HTML and JS. PyWebIO can also be easily integrated into existing Web services. PyWebIO is very suitable for quickly building applications that do not require complex UI.
